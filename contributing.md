## Contributing without writing a line of code

There are many ways you can contribute to the project without having to write a single line of code!
- editing and updating the help/documentation is a fantastic contribution.
- making any tutorials, examples available is great too

## Contributing through code

Obviously, there is always work to do to make code better :-)

We are happy to have contributors fixing and improving the code or submitting new code. Note that for now we have Matlab and Python, but ahappy to support any other relevant language.

## Recognizing contributions

We welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development. Contributors are listed [here](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/blob/main/contributors.md) and when possible, we'd like to associate you to future publication.

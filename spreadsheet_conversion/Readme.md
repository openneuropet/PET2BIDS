# Spreadsheet conversion

When data are already converted, it can be easier to create metadata separately, here as json file to follow [PET-BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/09-positron-emission-tomography.html).

## 1 spreadsheet per subject

You can use the [single-subject template](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/raw/refs/heads/main/spreadsheet_conversion/single_subject_sheet/subject_metadata_template.xlsx) to prepare the metadata. Note that new/old excel (.xlsx .xls) or open format (.ods) can be used.  For reference, here is an [example spreadsheet](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/raw/refs/heads/main/spreadsheet_conversion/single_subject_sheet/subject_metadata_example.xlsx)

The example files, show the excel file and the resulting conversion as json.

## 1 spreadsheet for many subjects

In most cases, you subjects are converted (say using dcm2niix) and you need to update the json files with the metadata for all subjects. This is easily acheived using our preformated [scanner excel sheet](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/blob/main/spreadsheet_conversion/many_subjects_sheet/scanner_metadata_template.xlsx) which applies that information to all and the [tracer related excel sheet](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/blob/main/spreadsheet_conversion/many_subjects_sheet/subjects_metadata_template.xlsx). 

## convert_spreadsheet_metadata.m

The matlab function `convert_spreadsheet_metadata.m` can be called and users are prompted to select a spreadsheet, or it can be passed directly as input. If command line is used, output name can also be specified, otherwise the same location and name is used to create the json file.

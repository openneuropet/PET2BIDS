# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys
import pathlib


# some comments about path setup
# getting make html, etc to work locally is as simple as inserting the python project path into the system path
# variable using the following two lines of code:
# >>>python_project_path = os.path.abspath('../pypet2bids')
# >>>sys.path.insert(0, python_project_path)
# However, when readthedocs.io attempts to build the site within their system we get a bunch of import errors
# and no html gets built from our docstrings in our python code.
# some 'possibly' helpful links on changing/adjusting the path to make RTD.io work are:
# https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/7883
# https://github.com/python/python-docs-es/blob/c79c770adf608d2cf9ac707792c6c54b9fb01f89/conf.py#L112-L113

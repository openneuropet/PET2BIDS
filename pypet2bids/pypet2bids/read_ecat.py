"""
This module contains methods used to read ecat files (*.v), the primary method pulled/imported from this module
is read_ecat which returns the contents of a singular ecat file divided into three parts:

- main header
- subheaders
- pixel data

The other functions primarily operate bitwise, so it's best not to use them outside of this module, unless you are a
glutton or twisted in that sort of way.
